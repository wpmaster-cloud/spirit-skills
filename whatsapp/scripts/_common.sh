# _common.sh — shared helpers for the WhatsApp (Green API) skill scripts.
# Sourced by wa_setup.sh / wa_send.sh / wa_read.sh. Not meant to be run directly.
#
# Responsibilities:
#   * resolve credentials (GREENAPI_ID_INSTANCE / GREENAPI_API_TOKEN / GREENAPI_API_URL)
#   * provide wa_api() — a thin curl wrapper around the Green API
#   * provide wa_chat_id() — normalize a phone number into a chatId
#
# Dependencies: curl + jq (both are guaranteed in a spirit agent environment).

# --- credential resolution -------------------------------------------------
# Precedence: anything already in the environment wins (inherited from the
# agent process, which keeps the token out of the transcript). Only if the
# token is NOT already set do we source a config file:
#   1. $WA_CONFIG                (explicit path, if you set it)
#   2. whatsapp/config.env       (relative to the workspace root = run_command cwd)
#   3. skills/whatsapp/config.env (next to this skill)

# Green API routes each instance to a numbered subdomain whose prefix is the
# FIRST 4 DIGITS of the idInstance — e.g. instance 7107650767 lives on
# https://7107.api.greenapi.com (note: greenapi.com, no hyphen; uploads use the
# matching 7107.media.greenapi.com). The legacy shared host
# https://api.green-api.com (with a hyphen) returns 401/404 for modern accounts,
# so we DERIVE the per-instance host by default rather than hardcoding it.
# Override GREENAPI_API_URL (and GREENAPI_MEDIA_URL) only if your console shows a
# different host — use the value EXACTLY as the console shows it.
